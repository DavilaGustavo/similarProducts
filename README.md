# Similar Products

This repository contains a project that tries to solve the problem of a recommendation system based on products that are similar at each other. The dataset used isn't public avaiable, feel free to try implementing your own. The code is implemented in Python Notebook and utilizes popular used ways to find the similarity between objects/products.

## Implemented Features

1. ### Data Preprocessing
   - Loading the dataset and preparing the data, including handling missing values and converting categorical variables into list formats.

2. ### Recommendation
   - A function that do some recommendations using the product_id of your choice.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Python Libraries**: scikit-learn, pandas, nltk.
- **Development Environment**: Any Python IDE such as Jupyter Lab or Visual Studio Code.

## Main Project Structure

- **`similarProducts.ipynb`**: Main script to execute the recommendation system and to see it working.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
    - git clone <rep URL>

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
    - pip install scikit-learn pandas nltk

3. **Ensure the dataset is in the src directory**:
    - Make sure to download/create one

4. **Run the main script**:
    - Run Jupyter Lab or other IDE
    - Open and run similarProducts.ipynb

5. **Changes**:
    - Feel free to modify the code to adjust model parameters or experiment with different datasets.
